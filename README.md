# hackaton

> Add a short description here!

A longer description of your project goes here...

## Installation

In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. review and uncomment what you need in `environment.yml` and create an environment `hackaton` with the help of [conda]:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with:
   ```
   conda activate hackaton
   ```

> **_NOTE:_**  The conda environment will have hackaton installed in editable mode.
> Some changes, e.g. in `setup.cfg`, might require you to run `pip install -e .` again.


Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

3. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   # You might also want to run `pre-commit autoupdate`
   ```
   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

4. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:
   ```bash
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```
   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.


Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `environment.yml` and eventually
   in `setup.cfg` if you want to ship and install your package via `pip` later on.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `environment.lock.yml` for the exact reproduction of your
   environment with:
   ```bash
   conda env export -n hackaton -f environment.lock.yml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yml` using:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yml --prune
   ```
